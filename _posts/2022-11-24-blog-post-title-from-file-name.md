## Looking Forward and Some Insights

Good morning, day, or evening everyone! Midori's out today, so you're stuck with her older sister this time! I hope to 'host' a few more of these through the end of the year, so I really look forward to it! (Oh, this is going to be a quick one, so please excuse any mistakes!)

It's been a little while since Midori passed on the Team's notice regarding GitHub issues, so I thought I'd take the time to let you all know some of the interesting things beign discussed as well as some other bits and pieces from 'around the office'.

### Other Insights

Now, moving onto something super exciting. You may be wondering where Midori is, a fair question considering I would usually have to wrestle the keyboard away from her to do the updates in her place!
For the next few weeks, Midori is 'recording her English lines'! That's right, she's spent a while studying English with the Team and now feels confident enough to speak for everyone!

More information to come over the next month and a half, but updates may be a little slow while the Team is out with personal activites.

We all hope you're looking forward to it, I did have some more things to say, but I'm being called away!

Stay well – Rina.
