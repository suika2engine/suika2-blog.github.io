## Submitting Feedback, Feature Requests, and Bug Reports

Hey everyone, how have you all been? Good I hope!

The Team has had a discussion and we're now encouraging our users to submit issues via GitHub! If you have any feedback (on a current update or the implementation of a specific feature),
feature requests (preferably with an explanation or example), or bug reports, post an issue. If you're not sure how to use GitHub, don't worry, we're still as active as always on the official Discord, so drop by!

There's some cool stuff being discussed at the moment, so make sure to [have a look](https://github.com/suika2engine/suika2/issues).

Now, I'm going to go annoy Rina, thanks for reading and see you next time! (~ ^-^ ~)
