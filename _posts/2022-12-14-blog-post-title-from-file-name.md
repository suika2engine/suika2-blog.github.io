## A Year in Review – Moving Forward, 2022 to 2023

Hi everyone, I hope you've all been doing well as this year enters the last half of its last month.

I thought I'd post today, just to go over the the last year as well as to outline how things are going to be moving forward as we roll-over into the next.

### Suika2 Today

This year has been amazing for Suika2! Not only have updates been consistantly improvement and feature-rich, but a brand new team have all
come together to create the best possible visual novel creation tool that's freely availble to anyone who wants to explore the brilliant
medium that is visual novels.

Some awesome improvements this year:
* The release of Suika2 Pro!
* Lots of bug fixes
* Face-sprites
* Increased number of supported formats
* Documentation Overhaul
* Increased community interaction and involvement!
* Probably hundreds more!

A major aspect of Suika2's development this year has been its documentation. New and existing users can now feel confident in their work knowing
that they can rely upon up-to-date, relevant, and intuitive documentation throughout their development process.

The documentation is currently availble via GitHub (no account required), see [here](https://github.com/suika2engine/suika2/wiki).
A printible, offline-friendly PDF version of the documentation will also be availble from the [official website](https://docs.suika2.com) in the future, so please look forward to that!

### Moving Forward

If you've ever read posts from this blog before, you'll know that when they're posted and what they talk about is a bit here-and-there.
Because of this, posts will now be up around the end of each month starting February. This means that they'll have a bit more to them
and have some proper regularity!

These posts will, of course, discuss the latest updates and discussions related to Suika2, but also some neat tips+tricks, templates, and resources
to help you create the best possible stories!

### Thank You!

Lastly, it should go without saying that The Team is extremely thankful to everyone who has joined our wonderful community, as we continue to grow,
I'm sure Suika2 will follow suit.

Remember that you can always contact us via e-mail (`midori@suika2.com`) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/ZmvXxE8GFg) if you have any questions, feedback, or just want to say hi!

Happy Holidays, Stay Safe, See You Soon, また来年 – Kyou and Team!
