## The Suika2 Blog Launches

Hey, I'm Midori, it's so nice to see you! We've probably met before, but if not, I'm the ditzy deuteragonist who gives people the run down on Suika2!

Okay, so a little bit about me: I go to a small-town school on the Hokkaido coast, but I have a habbit of 'forgetting' my time table; I'm usually on the roof playing visual novels or reading instead, the sea-breeze is too nice to be indoors! Anyway, when I'm not talking about Suika2 with my friends or helping ktabata answer emails, I help my parents on their watermelon farm, I even have a watermelon tie and super awesome hair ribbons!

So, on behalf of the [Suika2 Development Team](https://github.com/suika2engine), welcome to my blog! Here I'll talk about updates and cool behind-the-scenes info that the Team share with me from time-to-time, I might even share some of my 'slice-of-life'!

I look forward to hearing from you, and I hope you enjoy reading!
