Heya everyone, it's Midori! I hope you've all been having a lovely week, because I sure have; did you know that Kei has been implementing some awesome
new features to help NVL-style presentation? Something tells me Suika2.11.5 is going to be a big update for NVL writers... Oh, but don't worry, ADV is
still getting improvements, so keep an eye out for what's to come in the future, you don't want to miss out!

Okay, so by now we all know that I could go on and on about Suika2 (let's be honest, who couldn't?), but today I have a super special announcement to make,
well it's more like an introduction: My older sister just arrived back from school in Tokyo and she's been waiting to meet you all, I hope you'll accept her!

Good day, morning, or evening everyone, it's so nice to finally meet you all! Midori has told me so much about the community she's a member of, and I can see why!
She has so many awesome friends from all over the world – I hope you'll welcome me in the same way you've welcomed her.
Oh, I should probably introduce myself if that's to be the case. I'm Rina, Midori's older sister. I've been attending University in Tokyo for the last few months
so I'm really glad to be home, I missed the fresh air and the smell of the ocean so much while I was away.

I'm brand new to the world of Suika2, so while Midori takes care of the updates and some of the behind-the-scenes info, I'll keep you all in the know regarding what we've been up to from time-to-time,
some relaxing slice-of-life is just what we all need!

...Fantastic – great intro Rina! I'm so happy I could finally introduce you today! Oh, by the way, you better not write anything embarrassing!

We'll see you all next time, stay safe – Midori and Rina.

Hey everyone, it's Kyo, I hope you've all been doing well. So, what do you think of Rina? She definitlly brings out Midori's immature side if you ask me!
This is just a quick reminder that while this is the official Suika2 Blog, we like to keep things a little informal here, you might spot some mistakes here and there, so please forgive me for those.
If you're looking for something more formal, I recommend checking out the Team's [GitHub](https://github.com/suika2engine/suika2). Okie dokie, with that out of the way, I hope you all have a fantastic week, see you later!
